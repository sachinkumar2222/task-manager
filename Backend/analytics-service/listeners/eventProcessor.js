  // In the future, this is where you would add more complex, real-time logic.
  // For example:
  //
  // 1. REAL-TIME DASHBOARD UPDATES:
  //    - If you had a WebSocket connection to the frontend, you could push an
  //      update to the relevant workspace's dashboard here.
  //    - e.g., websocketManager.sendToWorkspace(eventData.workspaceId, { type: 'STAT_UPDATE', payload: ... });
  //
  // 2. TRIGGERING NOTIFICATIONS:
  //    - If a certain threshold is met (e.g., 100 tasks completed in a day),
  //      this processor could trigger a call to the Notification Service to
  //      send a congratulatory email or in-app message.
  //
  // 3. COMPLEX DATA AGGREGATION:
  //    - For very high-traffic systems, you might update pre-aggregated summary
  //      tables here instead of calculating stats on the fly, making dashboard
  //      loads instant.

  // For our current implementation, we just log and complete.
